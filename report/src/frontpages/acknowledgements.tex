I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my mentor Professor Carl Sable
for his guidance, patience, and encouragement throughout this project. I would
also like to thank my teammates, Sun Kongsonthana, and Minahil Bakhtawar for
their collaboration, creativity, and teamwork during the development of the
Remote Micro-Robot middleware.

I am grateful to the College of Design and Engineering at the National University
of Singapore for providing the resources and support that made this work possible.
Finally, I would like to thank The Cooper Union for providing me with this
incredible opportunity to represent the school abroad.
