## potentially good cameras to use

- Highways vs streets?
    - Might be good to do several types
- Is hardware the same?
- Get the count of cars
    - Get a still of the road which might be different at different times
    - Then differentiate between road and camera

- Images without screencapture
    - Might be an app, might be existing solution
