### labeling process

- I'm gonna label cybertrucks as SUVs
- Buggies can be both considered "sedans" or "SUV" depending on whether or not it's electric or gas powered.
    - A standard MINI Cooper is more similar to a hatchback or wagon than a sedan or SUV (Google Search AI)
    - I'm grouping sedan and hatchback into the same group so buggies are being classified as sedans
- Now ran into the max number of "tasks" I can create
    - May have to try running locally to see if that bypasses this "premium" feature
    - Ran it locally and now it's fine
- Gonna include all of the tires, mirror, and car body into the box
