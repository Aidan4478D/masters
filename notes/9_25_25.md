## updates

- Got developer access to 511 NYC API portal
    - Able to query every 6 seconds (10 times a minute)
    - Get camera
        - Entity that streams the footage to the internet
        - Turns out images being streamed are already public [example](https://511ny.org/map/Cctv/3247)
        - Is the exact same image & quality as the website 
        - Video API calls have other info like roadway name, direction of travel (almost always NULL), camera ID, and specific coordinates
    - Get events
        - Don't have access? (403)
        - Seems like this is moreso linked to specific like traffic events
    - Get roadsigns
        - Message displayed on those electric road signs 
        - Long/lat, ID, name, roadway, direction of travel (not null this time!)
    - Get alerts
        - Alerts within a specific area?
        - Empty when I queried it

- Created a script to screenshot images and save to disk (inefficient)
- Created a script that is able to save images from the API
    - Uses a new directory for each camera and saves via timestamp
    - Can set this to capture every 6 seconds

- Cameras owned by different operators
    - NYSDOT, NYC DOT, or Skyline
    - Off of basic searches, doesn't seem like there's a standard traffic camera that either use

        - "Each camera shall be Pelco Esprit Model ES31PC22-2N"
        - Existing system is: Pelco 9760
        -  The general purpose of the CCTV camera equipment is to provide a means to remotely monitor traffic flow on a section of roadway.

        - "Each camera shall be Axis Communications model Q1614-E"

- Look into kaggle datasets and those images and how they compare
- Consider what image classification architectures are freely available to use from HF
