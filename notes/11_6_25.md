- There are a lot of different conditions that we can capture these vehicles in
    - Sunny (no glare)
    - Sunny (glare)
    - Cloudy
    - Night (no glare)
    - Night (glare)

- One camera from brooklyn wasnt producing any good images so now just working with 12 cameras
    - Looking to label 100 photos per camera to train model for making bounding boxes
    - Created labeling set for 10/12 cameras
    - Tedious process creating this labeling set as I can't just random sample
