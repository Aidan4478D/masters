## 1. Using traffic cameras to identify cars
- Set cameras up outside cooper?
    - Might need IRB approcal
- Public access to traffic cameras ==> yes
- Is the data stored anywhere
    - NYC Department of Transportation (DOT)
        - Provides public access to livestreams but does not make recorded data avialable
        - [https://webcams.nyctmc.org/map](https://webcams.nyctmc.org/map)
    - [https://pig.observer/nyc/#420,493,1085](https://pig.observer/nyc/#420,493,1085)
        - Same cameras, might have better resolution
    - [https://newyorkcity.trafficcamarchive.com/](https://newyorkcity.trafficcamarchive.com/)
        - Yes but really expensive ($250 for one hour)
        - Of the same quality as the other cameras

        - Free but archive link doesn't work?
        - Need to file an "archive request" for the footage that you want but it seems to be geared toward preventing police brutality.
        - Site looks to be taken down.

## 2. Detecting the smoke from cars
- Ask Harry Lim for the dataset he used
- Potentially use other sensors like thermal cameras to see what's coming out of cars
