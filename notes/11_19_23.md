## starting experimenting with models
- Using Facebook's DINOv3 for feature etraction [https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov3](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov3)
    - Models are on HuggingFace [https://huggingface.co/facebook/dinov3-convnext-tiny-pretrain-lvd1689m](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dinov3-convnext-tiny-pretrain-lvd1689m)
- Task specific DETR (Detection Transformer) for object detection
- Code insipired from [https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/tasks/training_vision_backbone](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/tasks/training_vision_backbone)
    - This like straight up doesn't work
    - Going to switch to DINOv2 for now as that's suppored through HuggingFace autoconfig

- Trained a model classifier on like 75 images with frozen DINOv2 backbone
    - Is like kinda awful
