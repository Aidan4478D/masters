- Want to focus on vehicle type recognition

Existing implementations

- An Adaptive Vehicle Detection Model for Traffic Surveillance of Highway Tunnels Considering Luminance Intensity (2024) 
    - [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11436040/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11436040/)
    - Vehicle detection under abnormal lighting conditions (in this case highway tunnels)
    - Adaptive model that accounts for varying luminance intensities
    - Will adjust the brightness of images to a normal level using GANs
    - Used YOLOv8 for vehicle detection (they're working with real time)
- Classification of Car Body Type using Deep Transfer Learning (2021)
    - [https://www.irjet.net/archives/V8/i11/IRJET-V8I11276.pdf](https://www.irjet.net/archives/V8/i11/IRJET-V8I11276.pdf)
    - Used transfer learning (model trained on different data and used that pre-trained model for this task)
    - In this case they used a pre-trained ResNet, EfficientNet and Densenet
    - Classified into Cab, Convertible, Coupe, Hatchback, Minivan, Sedan, SUV, Van, Wagon, and others.
    - Found that the car body types are very challenging to predict as some of the cars can belong to multiple categories and there arenâ€™t many visual differences between categories like convertible and coupe
    - Used a lot of data augmentation to have more examples for training
    - Trained using StanfordCars dataset
    - Seems like a pretty simple model and got around 88% accuracy using EfficientNet_B4
- A Multi-Angle Appearance-Based Approach for Vehicle Type and Brand Recognition Utilizing Faster Regional Convolution Neural Networks (2023)
    - [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10708788/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10708788/)
    - Used Faster R-CNN
    - Classified across 5 vehicle types (buses, microbuses, minivans, sedans, SUVs, and trucks)
    - Used StanfordCars and BIT-Vehicle datasets
    - Created their own dataset called Car5_48 (manually annotated, soruced from the internet and vehicle videos with varied lighting and background conditions)
    - Has 8 different views of each vehicle
    - "Recognition network is composed of three primary components: a feature extraction network, a region proposal network (RPN), and a classification location refinement network"
    - Achieved overall accuracy of 97.62% across all vehicles using their framework on their dataset
- Real-Time Classification of Vehicles Using Machine Learning Algorithm on the Extensive Dataset (2024)
    - Random wavelet transform for pre-processing, edge and region-based segmentation for feature extraction, an embedded method for feature selection, and the XGBoost algorithm for VC
    - Classifies vehicles under complex weather, illumination, color, and occlusion conditions
    - Created their own dataset called SRM2KTR (75,436 vehicle images)
    - Clasifies images in 0.16 ns with an average accuracy of 97.79%
