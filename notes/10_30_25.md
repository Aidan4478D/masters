### IRB Approval
Do not need! Asked Dean Shay and she said: "The subject of your research is vehicles, with people only incidentally in the picture. Therefore, IRB approval is not needed"

#### Labels
- Changed label categories again, this time further grouping vehicles
- Giving labels a deeper level of specificity thorugh "attributes"
    - Just another layer of differentation between the same label
    - Ex. for sedans, there is like `is_police` instead of a `police_cruiser` its own label itself since the cruisers are sedans.
- Found the website CVAT [https://app.cvat.ai/tasks/create?projectId=327477](https://app.cvat.ai/tasks/create?projectId=327477) which lets you add attributes
